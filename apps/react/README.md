# React

## Description

This is a starter bare-bones React app that uses Vite as the build tool.
It is set up to use TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Shadcn-ui.

The app is compatible with a tauri setup - although it is currently missing a router.

## TODO:

- Add a router
- Add a tauri setup

There is also a dockerfile at the root of the monorepo that can be used to build the app into a container (static nginx server).
